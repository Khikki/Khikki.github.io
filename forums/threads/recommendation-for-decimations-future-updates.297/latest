								<div class="bbWrapper"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 26px">What I would like to see added to Decimation</span></span></b><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px">One thing I would really like to see added to Decimation is a more so survival factor over the killing everybody factor. This would mean making some sort of way to have an extremely large map that could be modified to certain points. This would also mean adding several things that Decimation is currently lacking. Such as detailed cars, a more complex crafting system, farming etc. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 26px">What does all of this mean?</span></span></b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px">This means you would spawn in a random area on the map. The map would be huge making your chances of finding people rare but good because this would give you time to start a community with friends, find one to join or just explore a giant map helping people or killing people and destroying what they've built. This would give you more to do than just finding food, guns and killing people or dying to people. This adds more to survive with and I understand that this is something that would take a long time to do so I would recommend doing small things over time. I would help but I lack the skills to do so, but you can always teach me i'm open to learning to do stuff like this. In the end this would be an apocalypse where you can do whatever you want. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 26px">How would basing work?</span></span></b></span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px">Basing would be a simple factor. You would find some place you like, such as a house, and inside the house you would be able to use a claim sort of feature making it so people can't just destroy it or you yourself destroy everything. Most blocks wouldn't be able to be removed but I would like to see furniture that could be removed, built or recycled into something new. This would mean you could modify the living room of a house to hold your food, guns and ammo. On shelves for example that you find in a grocery store and set up. This also means you wouldn't be able to just destroy blocks but more so windows and furniture. Keeping the map in one piece and not extremely griefed or filled with bad things.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px">You could cook, store or live in your base. You would be able to craft needed items and this would be the area you could place things. One thing that would be more complicated would be putting a wall around your base or community. You would need to find things to either make a wall with or transport and set up a wall with. Maybe a little bit of inventory unrealisticness but it would be cool.</span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 26px">Cars</span></span></b></span></span></span><br />
Cars would be a very complex thing to get in the game but something that would change the game play a lot.<span style="font-size: 15px"> Cars wouldn't be commonly usable. They would need parts to be fixed and gas to run. You would be able to loot them or store things in them. Let's say you find a car you want to use but the tire's popped so you would need to find a tire on the map and fix it. Then the car could be driven, of course cars that are very destroyed but barely work would have more risk. You would be able to transport people and items in your car from place to place and maybe even something like an R.V. could be added for a transportable base. Once again, cars would be a very hard thing to have like this but the hopes of having to make them fixable would make them a lot harder to get.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 26px">What would there be to craft and do?</span></span></b></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="font-size: 15px">The items that would be craftable would be bullets, gun parts like stocks, barrels etc. whatever you might need to make a gun and other things like shelves to store food or a wall to build around your community to keep the infected out. I would also like to see Infected in hordes more than they currently are. Also, they should follow loud noises such as someone talking or a gunshot from the distance. I would also like to see a working walkie-talkie voice chat system with text-chat also usable for those without a microphone. It would also be cool to see zombies have more of a shuffle in their walk like with the mod mo' bends. Don't forget, things such as grenades and rocket launchers would be capable of destroying block but the ammo, grenades and rpg would be hard to find. So don't plan on finding one and destroying the entire map with it. </span></span><br />
<br />
Loot in my decision for this to work would have to be a one time spawn. This would make everything more usable to the player and mean if they leave something behind someone else can find it in that trash can or Military helicopter that crashed. This means food would become a problem so plan on stocking up largely, finding a store to yourself or farming. Farming would mean you would be able to collect rain water, farm food in an area if you find what you need and then being able to jar things and put them on shelves. I would also like to see something like Weather and Seasons happen but that's just something that would be a cool add-on.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this would add a much larger survival aspect to Decimation and give people something to do or even give them an end goal. This doesn't mean you couldn't still play on the same old server's it would just be something for people who are looking at a game or mod pack that had more to do. If you have any question I will answer them to the best of my ability so honestly feel free to ask anything or state your concerns. Map building could be done quickly if a generator is made and we have enough buildings to generate said map with very little forest areas as this would be a horrible thing. I would like to see the map have farms, houses, town and cities with lots of different buildings. Make sure to leave a response on what you think about this</div>

			"articleBody": "What I would like to see added to Decimation\nOne thing I would really like to see added to Decimation is a more so survival factor over the killing everybody factor. This would mean making some sort of way to have an extremely large map that could be modified to certain points. This would also mean adding several things that Decimation is currently lacking. Such as detailed cars, a more complex crafting system, farming etc. \n\nWhat does all of this mean?\nThis means you would spawn in a random area on the map. The map would be huge making your chances of finding people rare but good because this would give you time to start a community with friends, find one to join or just explore a giant map helping people or killing people and destroying what they've built. This would give you more to do than just finding food, guns and killing people or dying to people. This adds more to survive with and I understand that this is something that would take a long time to do so I would recommend doing small things over time. I would help but I lack the skills to do so, but you can always teach me i'm open to learning to do stuff like this. In the end this would be an apocalypse where you can do whatever you want. \n\nHow would basing work?\nBasing would be a simple factor. You would find some place you like, such as a house, and inside the house you would be able to use a claim sort of feature making it so people can't just destroy it or you yourself destroy everything. Most blocks wouldn't be able to be removed but I would like to see furniture that could be removed, built or recycled into something new. This would mean you could modify the living room of a house to hold your food, guns and ammo. On shelves for example that you find in a grocery store and set up. This also means you wouldn't be able to just destroy blocks but more so windows and furniture. Keeping the map in one piece and not extremely griefed or filled with bad things.\n\nYou could cook, store or live in your base. You would be able to craft needed items and this would be the area you could place things. One thing that would be more complicated would be putting a wall around your base or community. You would need to find things to either make a wall with or transport and set up a wall with. Maybe a little bit of inventory unrealisticness but it would be cool.\n\nCars\nCars would be a very complex thing to get in the game but something that would change the game play a lot. Cars wouldn't be commonly usable. They would need parts to be fixed and gas to run. You would be able to loot them or store things in them. Let's say you find a car you want to use but the tire's popped so you would need to find a tire on the map and fix it. Then the car could be driven, of course cars that are very destroyed but barely work would have more risk. You would be able to transport people and items in your car from place to place and maybe even something like an R.V. could be added for a transportable base. Once again, cars would be a very hard thing to have like this but the hopes of having to make them fixable would make them a lot harder to get.\n\nWhat would there be to craft and do?\n\nThe items that would be craftable would be bullets, gun parts like stocks, barrels etc. whatever you might need to make a gun and other things like shelves to store food or a wall to build around your community to keep the infected out. I would also like to see Infected in hordes more than they currently are. Also, they should follow loud noises such as someone talking or a gunshot from the distance. I would also like to see a working walkie-talkie voice chat system with text-chat also usable for those without a microphone. It would also be cool to see zombies have more of a shuffle in their walk like with the mod mo' bends. Don't forget, things such as grenades and rocket launchers would be capable of destroying block but the ammo, grenades and rpg would be hard to find. So don't plan on finding one and destroying the entire map with it. \n\nLoot in my decision for this to work would have to be a one time spawn. This would make everything more usable to the player and mean if they leave something behind someone else can find it in that trash can or Military helicopter that crashed. This means food would become a problem so plan on stocking up largely, finding a store to yourself or farming. Farming would mean you would be able to collect rain water, farm food in an area if you find what you need and then being able to jar things and put them on shelves. I would also like to see something like Weather and Seasons happen but that's just something that would be a cool add-on.\n\n\nAll of this would add a much larger survival aspect to Decimation and give people something to do or even give them an end goal. This doesn't mean you couldn't still play on the same old server's it would just be something for people who are looking at a game or mod pack that had more to do. If you have any question I will answer them to the best of my ability so honestly feel free to ask anything or state your concerns. Map building could be done quickly if a generator is made and we have enough buildings to generate said map with very little forest areas as this would be a horrible thing. I would like to see the map have farms, houses, town and cities with lots of different buildings. Make sure to leave a response on what you think about this",
