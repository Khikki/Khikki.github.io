								<div class="bbWrapper"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 22px">Furniture</span></span></b><br />
There should be lootable furniture in the house like kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and drawers. These would have things like kitchen knives, crackers, canned food, chips, drinks and rotting food.<br />
<b>.Living Room furniture like</b> .<br />
-different colored couches<br />
-cushioned chairs different colors<br />
-coffee tables<br />
-night stands<br />
-tall and short lamps.<br />
<b>.Bedroom Furniture like </b><br />
-more realistic beds different colors<br />
-curtains<br />
-floor rugs<br />
<b>.Bathroom items like </b><br />
-showers<br />
-bathtubs<br />
-sinks<br />
-medicine cabinets<br />
-toilets<br />
-toilet paper<br />
<br />
I would like to see most of these things be lootable as they would do nicely for more detailed maps to play on. Also, could you add something for server owners to make it so they can make loot a one time spawn?<br />
<br />
I would also like to see more doors get added like front doors for houses, a garage door block or door in general, inside doors for rooms and closet doors. Maybe even some sort of retail door that slides over when used.<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 22px">Basing</span></span></b><br />
Another thing I would like to see is being able to claim houses or buildings. My idea for this would be using the electric boxes in the game. You would have different types of Electric Boxes that claim up to a certain radius. Like boxes for a house so someone doesn't claim part of another house etc. This would also mean maybe making it so Shelves could be used to store food on. This would make it so player could have somewhere to put their supplies and defend.<br />
<br />
Putting locks on doors would also be a cool thing. Like having different tier locks. This adds on to the idea above so when the player is offline their house/building can't be broken into and supplies stolen. I would also have it so after 1-2 weeks of inactivity the house is unclaimed and what's inside is open for other players to take. I would also like to see some sort of thing like CD has with blueprints in Decimation but different. Such as having a rare lootable crafting table in loot to use to craft things. Such as bandages from clothes and things like barbed wire from scrap metal.<br />
<br />
You would want to have it that the person who claims the house has to be in a large clan. A clan with at least 10+ people. This would mean clan members could claim houses in the area around that one and form a clan base/headquarters. You might even be able to make it so the loot in the houses is disabled and Weapon Cabinets become storage for guns and ammo, loot crates become storage for things like empty cans and bottle then having empty shelves left to put canned/jarred goods on. This would allow the player to be able to empty out their bags in their base and go get more loot.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you should make something place-able like fences around the area so the clan can keep infected from coming in or spawning in. You would want to make it so the infected or zombies spawn outside the claimed area so the player isn't getting infected constantly. Something like a fence on wheels that rolls to the side would be cool as well. You would want staff to fly around the map and make sure that no one is abusing the basing system. This would also mean putting in a set of rules for those who choose to base need to follow or get punished.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-size: 22px"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Crafting</span></span></b><br />
A crafting system would be really awesome to see come to Decimation. As expected there may be bugs but they could be fixed over time. It would be cool to have different types of crafting tables like a general table, smelting table and jarring/canning table. Also, finding pots to cook stuff in over the fire would be cool. For most of this everything you find could be lootable and then recycled to be re-used. You could clean out the cans and jars after being used to hold more food. You could also melt down the cans and mold them into a certain types of bullets. You could also add things like watches etc. to melt down to get brass for things like 5.56 round ammo. This would also mean making gunpowder craftable and having to be mixed with the bullet casing to work.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-size: 22px">Farming</span></span></b><br />
Farming is a feature I think that would be really cool to also see in Decimation. Farming could be something to do in the backyard of the house your living in. You could find fertilizer in things around the map along with Gardening Borders being lootable. The first thing you would need is a base and a bucket. The buckets would be lootable and place-able to collect rain water or dump water bottles into. You could also make buckets of dirty water able to be placed on a campfire to purify.<br />
<br />
Once you have the bucket of water, you would need to have a gardening border. These borders would be able to be placed around the area you want to fertilize and farm. You would cover each block with a bag of fertilizer and then right click the dry fertilizer with the bucket to irrigate it. 1 Bucket of water would be able to irrigate 8 blocks of dry fertilizer to now plant seeds on. Once completely fertilized you could use seeds you found to plant. Then once grown you would right click the crops and then have to jar/can the food for later.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 18px">Some of you may have read my last forum post and if it seems like I am just spamming the forums re-saying what I already said that's false. I am going into more detail about a lot of things I talked about. In my next post, I will try to cover how I would like to see a car system work so there isn't any fps problems and it's rewarding. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to drop them down below. I plan on releasing a video covering all of this if not 3 separate videos so there isn't just one fifteen minute long video.</span></div>

			"headline": "Furniture, Basing, Crafting and Farming. More suggestions for Decimation.",
			"articleBody": "Furniture\nThere should be lootable furniture in the house like kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and drawers. These would have things like kitchen knives, crackers, canned food, chips, drinks and rotting food.\n.Living Room furniture like .\n-different colored couches\n-cushioned chairs different colors\n-coffee tables\n-night stands\n-tall and short lamps.\n.Bedroom Furniture like \n-more realistic beds different colors\n-curtains\n-floor rugs\n.Bathroom items like \n-showers\n-bathtubs\n-sinks\n-medicine cabinets\n-toilets\n-toilet paper\n\nI would like to see most of these things be lootable as they would do nicely for more detailed maps to play on. Also, could you add something for server owners to make it so they can make loot a one time spawn?\n\nI would also like to see more doors get added like front doors for houses, a garage door block or door in general, inside doors for rooms and closet doors. Maybe even some sort of retail door that slides over when used.\nBasing\nAnother thing I would like to see is being able to claim houses or buildings. My idea for this would be using the electric boxes in the game. You would have different types of Electric Boxes that claim up to a certain radius. Like boxes for a house so someone doesn't claim part of another house etc. This would also mean maybe making it so Shelves could be used to store food on. This would make it so player could have somewhere to put their supplies and defend.\n\nPutting locks on doors would also be a cool thing. Like having different tier locks. This adds on to the idea above so when the player is offline their house\/building can't be broken into and supplies stolen. I would also have it so after 1-2 weeks of inactivity the house is unclaimed and what's inside is open for other players to take. I would also like to see some sort of thing like CD has with blueprints in Decimation but different. Such as having a rare lootable crafting table in loot to use to craft things. Such as bandages from clothes and things like barbed wire from scrap metal.\n\nYou would want to have it that the person who claims the house has to be in a large clan. A clan with at least 10+ people. This would mean clan members could claim houses in the area around that one and form a clan base\/headquarters. You might even be able to make it so the loot in the houses is disabled and Weapon Cabinets become storage for guns and ammo, loot crates become storage for things like empty cans and bottle then having empty shelves left to put canned\/jarred goods on. This would allow the player to be able to empty out their bags in their base and go get more loot.\n\nLastly, you should make something place-able like fences around the area so the clan can keep infected from coming in or spawning in. You would want to make it so the infected or zombies spawn outside the claimed area so the player isn't getting infected constantly. Something like a fence on wheels that rolls to the side would be cool as well. You would want staff to fly around the map and make sure that no one is abusing the basing system. This would also mean putting in a set of rules for those who choose to base need to follow or get punished.\n\nCrafting\nA crafting system would be really awesome to see come to Decimation. As expected there may be bugs but they could be fixed over time. It would be cool to have different types of crafting tables like a general table, smelting table and jarring\/canning table. Also, finding pots to cook stuff in over the fire would be cool. For most of this everything you find could be lootable and then recycled to be re-used. You could clean out the cans and jars after being used to hold more food. You could also melt down the cans and mold them into a certain types of bullets. You could also add things like watches etc. to melt down to get brass for things like 5.56 round ammo. This would also mean making gunpowder craftable and having to be mixed with the bullet casing to work.\n\nFarming\nFarming is a feature I think that would be really cool to also see in Decimation. Farming could be something to do in the backyard of the house your living in. You could find fertilizer in things around the map along with Gardening Borders being lootable. The first thing you would need is a base and a bucket. The buckets would be lootable and place-able to collect rain water or dump water bottles into. You could also make buckets of dirty water able to be placed on a campfire to purify.\n\nOnce you have the bucket of water, you would need to have a gardening border. These borders would be able to be placed around the area you want to fertilize and farm. You would cover each block with a bag of fertilizer and then right click the dry fertilizer with the bucket to irrigate it. 1 Bucket of water would be able to irrigate 8 blocks of dry fertilizer to now plant seeds on. Once completely fertilized you could use seeds you found to plant. Then once grown you would right click the crops and then have to jar\/can the food for later.\n\nSome of you may have read my last forum post and if it seems like I am just spamming the forums re-saying what I already said that's false. I am going into more detail about a lot of things I talked about. In my next post, I will try to cover how I would like to see a car system work so there isn't any fps problems and it's rewarding. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to drop them down below. I plan on releasing a video covering all of this if not 3 separate videos so there isn't just one fifteen minute long video.",
