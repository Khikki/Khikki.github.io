      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Dear Community,<br />
<br />
I want to suggest some nice ideas which i have thought over, that should probably get added to make Decimation more realistic and increase the fun factor. <br />
<br />
Lets begin with the<br />
Vehicles:<br />
<br />
1) Humvee: 5 Seater, mounted .50 Cal MG (my favorite Vehicle for the ground), add trunk storage, so its getting possible to make a mobile base or supporting a clan with supplies<br />
2) AH-64D „Apache Longbow“: 2 Seater, AGM Hellfires, Hydra 70 and maybe some MG's, make it so that the Pilot is...<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I think snipers should be in the game because they could be used by everyone, right now you could only access them in single-player which doesn't really do anything to benefit the game. So the snipers we have right now like the <b>L115a3 (AWM) </b>and the <b>Snaiperskaya Vintoka (SV98) </b>should only be found in supply drops and have a 25% drop rate so it's by chance you get one of these things. Pros and normal players can benefit from this, another idea is that snipers like a <b>mosin...</b><br />

Please add Optifine Support on the Modpack, Most Players doesnt have a &quot;BEASTLY&quot; Computers/Laptops. its lagging too much for Client's Side, it would be amazing if you can make support Optifine only, im only asking for that particular mod no other mods, just that, so it can make player play the game smoothly even tho they have a low end pc. <br />

Thank you and please look into this Suggestion , its for the better of the mankind. \(^-^)/</div>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
I used to play on the old mod pack and server. I played on it for a few years and grew quite fond of the game. I decided to donate and buy a rank in game to hopefully make the game more fun. I was wondering if any of the perks I bought will be carried over into this new mod pack. I would understand if it didn't but it would be nice if you could work some sort of compensation for my previous purchase. <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div>]]></content:encoded>
