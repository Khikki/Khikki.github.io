This would mean making some sort of way to have an extremely large map that could be modified to certain points. This would also mean adding several things that Decimation is currently lacking.

<ul>
<li><b>Possible Reason:</b> You are using a 1.7.10 folder inside of your /mods/ folder. Sadly, the mod does not support this, meaning that you'll have to use the normal /mods/ folder without a 1.7.10 folder.<br />

Lets begin with the<br />

1) Humvee: 5 Seater, mounted .50 Cal MG (my favorite Vehicle for the ground), add trunk storage, so its getting possible to make a mobile base or supporting a clan with supplies<br />
