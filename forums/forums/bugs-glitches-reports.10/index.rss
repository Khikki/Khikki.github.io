<br />
I'm trying to make a single player / LAN experience map for a YouTube series but i'm hitting a few snags. Despite placing the props and loot boxes i'm completely unable to loot them, the problem also extends to supply drops.<br />
Another issue is that there doesn't seem to be any /deci commands to name and control areas selected by the wand of selection.<br />
I was wondering if there could be a fix for the looting anytime soon as it would be pretty integral for the video experience. I'm less...<br />

After this happened a 3rd time i decided that instead of losing all of my caps i would just disconnect. It seems that doing that glitched me and made me unable to reconnect. Every-time i do i disconnect again. Happens only on New York map but i can join the other map just fine. I dont really know what to do? Could i get a reset on my character or something?</div>]]></content:encoded>

How to patch: easy, just blacklist .litemod files :P</div>]]></content:encoded>

The R870 I had glitched and stopped firing after reloading too many times with ammo still in the mag. i have noticed a similar ammo glitch with revolvers but not as bad.</div>]]></content:encoded>

Whenever I start my game, it acts normal, I play at over 60-150 fps while I play, but the second I start going through my settings and start clicking buttons, it gets very laggy and whenever I click a done button, as in, ANY BUTTON THAT SAYS (DONE), I get a long lag spike lasting 5-20 seconds.
