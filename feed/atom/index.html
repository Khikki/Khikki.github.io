		<content type="html" xml:base="/command-changes-and-more/"><![CDATA[<p>In response to the comments I have been receiving concerning the permissions on the server, the following changes have been made:</p>
<p>Guests now have <strong>/tpa</strong> and <strong>/tpahere</strong> in order to more easily navigate the server and work together. Additionally, the <strong>/sethome</strong>, <strong>/delhome</strong>, and <strong>/home</strong> commands are now available for guest use. Guests are reminded that they can always return to their claimed plots in Elysium with a simple <strong>/plot home</strong> command.</p>
<p>Builders have access to the <strong>/mvtp</strong> command to traverse between worlds faster without first having to return to The Crossroads. Usage is as simple as typing <strong>/mvtp [worldname]</strong>, though please note that the world name must be fully typed out, as Multiverse does not infer your destination for you. A full list of available worlds can be obtained with the <strong>/mv list</strong> command.<span id="more-747"></span></p>
<p>Because some of these features were previously available only as donator perks, the donator rewards have accordingly changed and some perks have been rearranged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 donators gain the ability to use the <strong>/hat</strong> command to use blocks as festive head ware, and now have access to the <strong>/thru</strong>, <strong>/ascend</strong>, and <strong>/descend</strong> commands and the ability to use the compass item for these same powers; left clicking will teleport you <i>to</i> the area you are looking at, while right clicking will go <i>through</i> it.</li>
<li>Tier 2 donators now have access to the WorldEdit <strong>//repl</strong> tool, which allows for easy block substitutions with just a click.</li>
<li>Tier 3 donators gain the <b>/back</b> command to return to a location they were in before they teleported or crossed worlds.</li>
<li>Tier 4 donators now have the ability to use <strong>/lightning</strong> and <strong>/fireball</strong> for an extra bit of fun.</li>
</ul>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/texture-pack-update-to-1-5-1/"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, the server was upgraded to 1.5.1 earlier last week, and accordingly the way Minecraft clients handle textures has changed dramatically. I&#8217;ve spent the past few days going over the pack and revising it for 1.5.1, and I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve reached a point where I&#8217;m happy to provide an <a href="/downloads/">up-to-date version</a> for the latest version of Minecraft. This new version of the texture pack <strong>no longer requires</strong> Optifine, but players who go to the extra trouble of installing it will be treated to CTM support and more attractive sky textures that are included in the pack. <span id="more-728"></span></p>
<p>Some blocks have been altered for visual consistency, and animated textures for the following blocks have been added:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:40px;line-height:16px;padding-bottom:10px;">
<li>Redstone Dust</li>
<li>Glowstone Dust</li>
<li>Glowstone Blocks</li>
<li>Torches</li>
<li>Gold and Iron bars</li>
<li>All varieties of Bucket</li>
<li>Emeralds</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
<li>All varieties of Ore Blocks</li>
<li>Fire Charges</li>
<li>Jack-o-lanterns</li>
<li>Comparators and Repeaters</li>
<li>Activator Rails</li>
<li>Command Blocks</li>
<li>Clocks and Compasses</li>
</ul>
<p>As I find time, I&#8217;ll look at updating more of the textures, but for now I wanted to ensure that the pack was available for use.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/go-for-liftoff/"><![CDATA[<p>Well, I&#8217;ve put it off as long as I can, I think. It&#8217;s time to launch! It&#8217;s been a lot of work over the past month and a half or so, and a lot of changes have transpired specifically over the past few days. First and foremost, we have migrated servers. We are now hosted on a dedicated machine in a datacenter in Canada with an immaculate connection, more RAM than we know what to do with, and a processor that should be able to laugh off the worst we throw at it. This is the big one, and our hosting costs have gone up a bit as a result, but I&#8217;m confident it&#8217;ll be worth it and I&#8217;m willing to bankroll it for a while to prove the server&#8217;s vision.<span id="more-687"></span></p>
<p>Secondly, I&#8217;ve started the Map Image project for the server, which is an initiative I want to pursue to use maps as in-game &#8216;posters&#8217; to help players navigate the server and to add a lot of flavor and character to the worlds. All of the worlds on the server now have map images to go along with them so that the portals that lead to them from The Crossroads are clearly marked. Here&#8217;s some examples:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_elysium.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-688" alt="mc_map_elysium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_elysium.png" width="128" height="128" /></a>Â  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_wilderock.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-690" alt="mc_map_wilderock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_wilderock.png" width="128" height="128" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_thule.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-691" alt="mc_map_thule" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_thule.png" width="128" height="128" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_crossroads.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-692" alt="mc_map_crossroads" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc_map_crossroads.png" width="128" height="128" /></a></div>
<p>I typically view pixel art as a blight on Minecraft, but in this particular instance it&#8217;s proving to be incredibly useful. Now we can do things like make in-universe posters for Rapture, or post helpful arrows to guide players around! I&#8217;m hoping I get some good artists in the community to help me with this.</p>
<p>Now, I know that Minecraft 1.5 just came out. Believe me, nobody is more interested in getting patched up and playing with the new Redstone toys than I am. However, for the sake of my sanity and the server&#8217;s stability, we&#8217;re going to stay nice and cozy on Minecraft 1.4.7 for a while &#8211; at least until I see that all of the core plugins that are required to keep the server afloat have patched without issue.</p>
<p>With all that said, things are looking fairly positive, and I&#8217;m hoping to start inviting the community at large to come play on Crafti.ca shortly! If you&#8217;re looking for somewhere new, consider giving the server a shot. I think you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

Preliminary textures for 1.5 are also in the works, so hopefully an update will be available once Jeb finishes mucking about with these snapshots and actually pushes us the upcoming changes. Please keep in mind that because this is aÂ <strong>32x pack</strong>, some of the features such as enhanced lava and water animations will not be available unless you first install <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-147-optifine-hd-c3-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/">Optifine</a>.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="/crafti-ca-is-nearing-launch/"><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been hard at work setting up the foundation of Crafti.ca &#8211; finishing the <a href="/projects/crossroads/">Crossroads</a>, tweaking plugins and permissions, and ensuring that all the bells and whistles we&#8217;re implementing work together as seamlessly as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, we&#8217;ve managed to set the donations page up to interface with the server directly, so any promotions or perks associated with donating should take place almost immediately. We&#8217;ve also set up a handy little monthly donation bar on the right-hand side of the site, so you can see just how your contributions help the server meet its goals! We&#8217;re currently hosted via the fantastic guys over at <a href="http://enforcercraft.com/order/">EnforcerCraft</a>, who offer both dirt-cheap hosting and powerful options for us to hopefully grow into down the road.<span id="more-550"></span></p>
<p>A copy of the code powering <a href="https://minotar.net/">Minotar</a> has also been implemented on the site, and it follows a similar URL structure. We&#8217;ve successfully integrated this into both the main site and our forums, so any time an avatar is required it should automatically default to your minecraft skin, provided the username you use is the same as your in-game Minecraft name. Similarly, the server status checks have now successfully been implemented throughout the whole site, and should provide at-a-glance information fairly reliably in the top right of every page in the header.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also been looking at pushing the same sort of permissions for donators on the forum in the form of fancy forum badges, but thusfar we have been unsuccessful in actually making the server and phpBB communicate effectively. There are a few bukkit plugins that already exist to solve this problem, but all of them are designed to pull information and permissions <em>from</em> the forums <em>to</em> the server, and not to push them the other way around. Also complicating this task is the fact that phpBB forums are very security-minded, and as a result are incredibly paranoid about accepting any inbound data from outside sources.</p>
<p>While Ein furiously tries to finish the back-end of things and rewrite site content, those of you who have gotten early access are encouraged to pursue the job of turning the Crossroads into something more resembling an adventure map for our future exploration-minded guests to enjoy. At this point, we anticipate launch is only a few days away &#8211; stay tuned!</p>
