				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the comments I have been receiving concerning the permissions on the server, the following changes have been made:</p>
<p>Guests now have <strong>/tpa</strong> and <strong>/tpahere</strong> in order to more easily navigate the server and work together. Additionally, the <strong>/sethome</strong>, <strong>/delhome</strong>, and <strong>/home</strong> commands are now available for guest use. Guests are reminded that they can always return to their claimed plots in Elysium with a simple <strong>/plot home</strong> command.</p>
<p>Builders have access to the <strong>/mvtp</strong> command to traverse between worlds faster without first having to return to The Crossroads. Usage is as simple as typing <strong>/mvtp [worldname]</strong>, though please note that the world name must be fully typed out, as Multiverse does not infer your destination for you. A full list of available worlds can be obtained with the <strong>/mv list</strong> command.<span id="more-747"></span></p>
<p>Because some of these features were previously available only as donator perks, the donator rewards have accordingly changed and some perks have been rearranged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 donators gain the ability to use the <strong>/hat</strong> command to use blocks as festive head ware, and now have access to the <strong>/thru</strong>, <strong>/ascend</strong>, and <strong>/descend</strong> commands and the ability to use the compass item for these same powers; left clicking will teleport you <i>to</i> the area you are looking at, while right clicking will go <i>through</i> it.</li>
<li>Tier 2 donators now have access to the WorldEdit <strong>//repl</strong> tool, which allows for easy block substitutions with just a click.</li>
<li>Tier 3 donators gain the <b>/back</b> command to return to a location they were in before they teleported or crossed worlds.</li>
<li>Tier 4 donators now have the ability to use <strong>/lightning</strong> and <strong>/fireball</strong> for an extra bit of fun.</li>
</ul>
