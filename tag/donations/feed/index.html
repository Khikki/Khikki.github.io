				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to the comments I have been receiving concerning the permissions on the server, the following changes have been made:</p>
<p>Guests now have <strong>/tpa</strong> and <strong>/tpahere</strong> in order to more easily navigate the server and work together. Additionally, the <strong>/sethome</strong>, <strong>/delhome</strong>, and <strong>/home</strong> commands are now available for guest use. Guests are reminded that they can always return to their claimed plots in Elysium with a simple <strong>/plot home</strong> command.</p>
<p>Builders have access to the <strong>/mvtp</strong> command to traverse between worlds faster without first having to return to The Crossroads. Usage is as simple as typing <strong>/mvtp [worldname]</strong>, though please note that the world name must be fully typed out, as Multiverse does not infer your destination for you. A full list of available worlds can be obtained with the <strong>/mv list</strong> command.<span id="more-747"></span></p>
<p>Because some of these features were previously available only as donator perks, the donator rewards have accordingly changed and some perks have been rearranged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 donators gain the ability to use the <strong>/hat</strong> command to use blocks as festive head ware, and now have access to the <strong>/thru</strong>, <strong>/ascend</strong>, and <strong>/descend</strong> commands and the ability to use the compass item for these same powers; left clicking will teleport you <i>to</i> the area you are looking at, while right clicking will go <i>through</i> it.</li>
<li>Tier 2 donators now have access to the WorldEdit <strong>//repl</strong> tool, which allows for easy block substitutions with just a click.</li>
<li>Tier 3 donators gain the <b>/back</b> command to return to a location they were in before they teleported or crossed worlds.</li>
<li>Tier 4 donators now have the ability to use <strong>/lightning</strong> and <strong>/fireball</strong> for an extra bit of fun.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been hard at work setting up the foundation of Crafti.ca &#8211; finishing the <a href="/projects/crossroads/">Crossroads</a>, tweaking plugins and permissions, and ensuring that all the bells and whistles we&#8217;re implementing work together as seamlessly as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, we&#8217;ve managed to set the donations page up to interface with the server directly, so any promotions or perks associated with donating should take place almost immediately. We&#8217;ve also set up a handy little monthly donation bar on the right-hand side of the site, so you can see just how your contributions help the server meet its goals! We&#8217;re currently hosted via the fantastic guys over at <a href="http://enforcercraft.com/order/">EnforcerCraft</a>, who offer both dirt-cheap hosting and powerful options for us to hopefully grow into down the road.<span id="more-550"></span></p>
<p>A copy of the code powering <a href="https://minotar.net/">Minotar</a> has also been implemented on the site, and it follows a similar URL structure. We&#8217;ve successfully integrated this into both the main site and our forums, so any time an avatar is required it should automatically default to your minecraft skin, provided the username you use is the same as your in-game Minecraft name. Similarly, the server status checks have now successfully been implemented throughout the whole site, and should provide at-a-glance information fairly reliably in the top right of every page in the header.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also been looking at pushing the same sort of permissions for donators on the forum in the form of fancy forum badges, but thusfar we have been unsuccessful in actually making the server and phpBB communicate effectively. There are a few bukkit plugins that already exist to solve this problem, but all of them are designed to pull information and permissions <em>from</em> the forums <em>to</em> the server, and not to push them the other way around. Also complicating this task is the fact that phpBB forums are very security-minded, and as a result are incredibly paranoid about accepting any inbound data from outside sources.</p>
<p>While Ein furiously tries to finish the back-end of things and rewrite site content, those of you who have gotten early access are encouraged to pursue the job of turning the Crossroads into something more resembling an adventure map for our future exploration-minded guests to enjoy. At this point, we anticipate launch is only a few days away &#8211; stay tuned!</p>
