				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, the server was upgraded to 1.5.1 earlier last week, and accordingly the way Minecraft clients handle textures has changed dramatically. I&#8217;ve spent the past few days going over the pack and revising it for 1.5.1, and I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve reached a point where I&#8217;m happy to provide an <a href="/downloads/">up-to-date version</a> for the latest version of Minecraft. This new version of the texture pack <strong>no longer requires</strong> Optifine, but players who go to the extra trouble of installing it will be treated to CTM support and more attractive sky textures that are included in the pack. <span id="more-728"></span></p>
<p>Some blocks have been altered for visual consistency, and animated textures for the following blocks have been added:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:40px;line-height:16px;padding-bottom:10px;">
<li>Redstone Dust</li>
<li>Glowstone Dust</li>
<li>Glowstone Blocks</li>
<li>Torches</li>
<li>Gold and Iron bars</li>
<li>All varieties of Bucket</li>
<li>Emeralds</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
<li>All varieties of Ore Blocks</li>
<li>Fire Charges</li>
<li>Jack-o-lanterns</li>
<li>Comparators and Repeaters</li>
<li>Activator Rails</li>
<li>Command Blocks</li>
<li>Clocks and Compasses</li>
</ul>
<p>As I find time, I&#8217;ll look at updating more of the textures, but for now I wanted to ensure that the pack was available for use.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crafti.ca texture pack has been released, and is available on our <a href="/downloads/">downloads page</a>. A <a href="/downloads/texture-pack-preview/">preview</a> is also available demonstrating the pack in a handful of environments. It is currently up-to-date for version 1.4.7 of Minecraft. Preliminary textures for 1.5 are also in the works, so hopefully an update will be available once Jeb finishes mucking about with these snapshots and actually pushes us the upcoming changes. Please keep in mind that because this is aÂ <strong>32x pack</strong>, some of the features such as enhanced lava and water animations will not be available unless you first install <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-147-optifine-hd-c3-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/">Optifine</a>.</p>
